# Minimum height magnetic tents for the skeletyl keyboard from bastardbk.com

These stl files contain magnetic tents from 5 to 30 degrees, allowing for fast, screw-less tent swapping.
You will need the original metal plates from the website for those to fit.

You will need to buy some 8mm x 3mm magnets on the side and simply just press fit them into the print.

NOTE:
- These tents will slide around on the desk if you have no desktop mat, corke or the like.
- Even with these mats and even with rubber pads, they are not as steadily fixated as the original. The 15 degree tent is conciderably more unstable than the 5 degree tent for reference.

Magnets are press fit into the outer holes. The mid hole is for not hitting a screw on the board.

Add it to the plat with one quick snap-on.

15 degree tent. Note that the tent may work okay-ish without magnets.

Adding pads will ensure better fixation, though still not as good fixation as the original tents with 4 feet.
